## 🚀 IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Portfolio

This repository houses all the labs, assignments, projects, and personal notes completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

The goal of this repo is to serve as a comprehensive portfolio showcasing my proficiency across the data science lifecycle, from data acquisition and cleaning to model building and deployment.

### 📜 Course Structure

The professional certificate consists of nine courses. Projects and labs for each course are organized into corresponding directories:

1.  **What is Data Science?**
2.  **Tools for Data Science**
3.  **Data Science Methodology**
4.  **Python for Data Science, AI & Development**
    * *Includes Python basics, data structures, and foundational libraries like Pandas and NumPy.*
5.  **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**
    * *Focuses on relational databases, SQL queries, and interacting with databases from Python.*
6.  **Data Analysis with Python**
    * *Covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), data wrangling, and statistical analysis.*
7.  **Data Visualization with Python**
    * *Projects using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for various visualization tasks.*
8.  **Machine Learning with Python**
    * *Implementation of supervised (e.g., Regression, Classification) and unsupervised (e.g., Clustering) learning algorithms.*
9.  **Applied Data Science Capstone**
    * *The final capstone project involving a real-world problem (e.g., location data analysis, business case).*

### 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

The projects heavily utilize the following technologies:

* **Languages:** Python, SQL
* **Core Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Scipy
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras (where applicable in later courses/capstone)
* **Environments:** Jupyter Notebooks, IBM Watson Studio

### 📁 How to Explore

You can navigate to the specific course folder you are interested in (e.g., `/Tools for Data Science`) to find the associated Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and data files (`.csv`, etc.).
